# dotfiles
an attempt at macos/linux dotfiles

I want everything to be the same regardless of what system I am on, if possible (i.e. when my home dir is on NFS on Linux). If that comes at the expense of features, that's fine, since I mainly want syntax and colors configured, not really any plugins or anything. This setup's goal is to be as portable as possible.
